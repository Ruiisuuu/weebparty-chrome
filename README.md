# WeebParty

WeebParty is a Chrome extension which synchronizes video playback on anime streaming websites (but can also work on most websites).

This is the Chrome extension. The source for the server can be found [here](https://github.com/ruiisuuu/weebparty-server).

Current state/ Todo :  
* The Chrome extension is functional but,
* you needs to manually press an "Inject" button each time a page changes.
* It also does not change the episode automatically
* Only one person can be a leader at a time
* Many edge error cases are not accounted for (in the Chrome extension and in the server).
